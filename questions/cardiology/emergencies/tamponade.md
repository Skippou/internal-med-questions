# Cardiac Tamponade Management

## Question
A 45-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer presents with acute dyspnea, hypotension (BP 82/60), and tachycardia (HR 125). Bedside echo shows a large pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse. Despite 2L of IV fluids, his condition worsens with:

- Pulsus paradoxus of 25 mmHg
- JVP 18 cm H2O
- Pulse oximetry 88% on 6L O2
- Altered mental status

Which combination of immediate management steps is most appropriate?

## Options
A) Immediate pericardiocentesis + supplemental O2 + call cardiology
B) Start dobutamine + IV fluids + prepare for OR
C) Pericardial window in OR + mechanical ventilation
D) Supplemental O2 + empiric antibiotics + CT chest
E) Start norepinephrine + mechanical ventilation + cardiology consult

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This is a case of life-threatening cardiac tamponade requiring immediate intervention:

1. Key diagnostic findings:
   - Beck's triad: hypotension, JVD, muffled heart sounds
   - Pulsus paradoxus >10 mmHg (here 25 mmHg)
   - Echo showing RV diastolic collapse
   - Known malignancy (common cause)

2. Critical management principles:
   - Emergent pericardiocentesis is indicated due to:
     * Hemodynamic compromise
     * Altered mental status
     * Failed fluid challenge
   - Delay for OR or imaging could be fatal
   - Inotropes/pressors won't address underlying problem
   - Mechanical ventilation could worsen cardiac output

3. Common pitfalls:
   - Waiting for CT imaging
   - Prioritizing mechanical ventilation
   - Over-reliance on medical management
