# Aortic Stenosis Management

## Question
A 75-year-old man presents with progressive dyspnea and chest pain on moderate exertion. Echo shows:

- Aortic valve area: 0.8 cm²
- Mean gradient: 45 mmHg
- Peak velocity: 4.2 m/s
- LVEF: 55%

Current Status:
- NYHA Class II-III symptoms
- Independent in daily activities
- No significant comorbidities

Vital Signs:
- BP: 132/82 mmHg
- HR: 78/min
- RR: 16/min
- SpO2: 97% on room air
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Medical management with beta-blocker and follow-up echo in 6 months |
| B)     | Referral for surgical AVR evaluation |
| C)     | Balloon aortic valvuloplasty |
| D)     | Referral for TAVR evaluation |
| E)     | Exercise stress test to confirm symptoms |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
This case presents severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in a relatively healthy elderly patient:

1. Key Diagnostic Findings:
   - Severe AS (valve area <1.0 cm², mean gradient >40 mmHg)
   - Symptoms correlating with AS
   - Preserved LV function
   - No major contraindications

2. Why Option B is optimal:
   - Surgical AVR is first-line for healthy elderly
   - Good surgical candidate (few comorbidities)
   - Class I indication per guidelines
   - Better long-term outcomes

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Medical therapy insufficient for severe symptomatic AS
   - C) Valvuloplasty only temporary bridge
   - D) TAVR second-line for lower-risk patients
   - E) Symptoms already clear, testing unnecessary
