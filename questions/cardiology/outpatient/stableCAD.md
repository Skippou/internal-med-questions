# Stable Coronary Artery Disease Management

## Question
A 62-year-old man with known coronary artery disease presents for medication adjustment. His history includes:

Medical History:
- Prior NSTEMI 2 years ago with PCI to LAD
- Type 2 diabetes (A1c 7.1%)
- Hypertension
- LDL 110 mg/dL on moderate-intensity statin

Current Status:
- CCS Class II angina (symptoms with moderate exertion)
- 2-3 episodes per week, responsive to sublingual nitroglycerin
- Good medication compliance

Vital Signs:
- BP: 142/88 mmHg
- HR: 72/min
- RR: 16/min
- BMI: 27 kg/mÂ²

Current Medications:
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg daily
- Metoprolol succinate 50mg daily
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg BID

Which medication change would be most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Add ranolazine |
| B)     | Increase atorvastatin to 80mg |
| C)     | Switch to carvedilol |
| D)     | Add long-acting nitrate |
| E)     | Add second antiplatelet |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
This case demonstrates key concepts in stable CAD management:

1. Why Increase Statin is Optimal:
   - LDL above secondary prevention goal (<70 mg/dL)
   - High-risk patient (diabetes + prior MI)
   - Room for dose escalation
   - Guidelines strongly recommend maximizing statin

2. Why Other Options Are Less Appropriate:
   - A) Ranolazine: Reserved for refractory symptoms
   - C) No clear advantage of carvedilol over metoprolol
   - D) Long-acting nitrates not first-line for occasional angina
   - E) DAPT typically not extended beyond 1 year post-PCI

3. Additional Considerations:
   - BP needs better control
   - Diabetes well-controlled
   - Appropriate use of evidence-based medications
   - Regular exercise should be encouraged

4. Secondary Prevention Goals:
   - LDL <70 mg/dL
   - BP <130/80 mmHg
   - A1c <7%
   - Regular exercise
   - Smoking cessation (if applicable)
