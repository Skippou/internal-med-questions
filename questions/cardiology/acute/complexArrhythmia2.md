# Acute Heart Failure Management

## Question
A 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents with worsening shortness of breath and leg swelling over the past week. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 150/90 mmHg
- HR: 110/min
- RR: 22/min
- SpO2: 88% on room air
- Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)

Physical Exam:
- Jugular venous distension
- Bilateral crackles in lung bases
- 2+ pitting edema in lower extremities

Labs:
- BNP: 1200 pg/mL
- Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
- Glucose: 180 mg/dL
- Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L

ECG shows sinus tachycardia with left ventricular hypertrophy.

Which initial management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | IV furosemide, oxygen therapy, and nitroglycerin |
| B)     | Oral metoprolol, fluid restriction, and ACE inhibitor |
| C)     | IV fluids, oxygen therapy, and spironolactone |
| D)     | Oral furosemide, oxygen therapy, and digoxin |
| E)     | IV nitroprusside, oxygen therapy, and beta-blocker |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This case presents acute decompensated heart failure with volume overload:

1. Contributing Factors:
   - Hypertension
   - Diabetes
   - Possible non-compliance with medications

2. Why Option A is optimal:
   - IV furosemide rapidly reduces volume overload
   - Oxygen therapy improves hypoxia
   - Nitroglycerin reduces preload and afterload

3. Why other options fail:
   - B) Metoprolol not first-line in acute setting
   - C) IV fluids worsen volume overload
   - D) Oral furosemide too slow, digoxin not first-line
   - E) Nitroprusside not first-line, beta-blocker not immediate

4. Critical Management Points:
   - Rapid diuresis
   - Oxygenation support
   - Blood pressure control

5. Key Considerations:
   - Monitor renal function
   - Adjust medications based on response
   - Address underlying causes
