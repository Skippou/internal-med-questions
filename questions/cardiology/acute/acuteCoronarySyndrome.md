# NSTEMI Management

## Question
A 58-year-old man presents with 3 hours of substernal chest pain. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 165/95 mmHg
- HR: 92/min
- RR: 18/min
- SpO2: 96% on room air
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)

Labs:
- Initial troponin I: 0.45 ng/mL (normal <0.04)
- Repeat troponin I (3h): 1.2 ng/mL
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
- Hemoglobin: 14.2 g/dL

ECG shows T-wave inversions in V3-V6 and normal sinus rhythm.

Which immediate management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Urgent cardiac catheterization |
| B)     | IV thrombolytics |
| C)     | ASA, heparin, beta-blocker; schedule early invasive strategy |
| D)     | ASA, clopidogrel; schedule stress test in 24h |
| E)     | Conservative management with oral anti-anginals |

## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
This case represents a NSTEMI with intermediate risk features:

1. Key Diagnostic Findings:
   - Rising troponins
   - Dynamic ECG changes
   - Typical chest pain
   - Multiple risk factors

2. Why Option C is optimal:
   - Follows current guidelines for NSTEMI
   - Provides appropriate anticoagulation
   - Controls symptoms and reduces ischemia
   - Plans for appropriate timing of intervention

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) No high-risk features requiring immediate cath
   - B) Thrombolytics contraindicated in NSTEMI
   - D) Insufficient for positive biomarkers
   - E) Too conservative for NSTEMI

4. Critical Management Points:
   - Early risk stratification
   - Dual antiplatelet therapy
   - Anticoagulation
   - Anti-ischemic therapy
