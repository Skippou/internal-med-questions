# New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation Management

## Question
A 68-year-old woman presents with palpitations and mild dyspnea for 2 days. Medical history includes hypertension and diabetes. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 142/88 mmHg
- HR: 142/min (irregular)
- RR: 20/min
- SpO2: 95% on room air
- Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F)

Labs:
- TSH: 2.1 mIU/L
- K⁺: 4.2 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
- Troponin: negative

ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, no acute ST-T changes.

CHA₂DS₂-VASc score: 4

Which initial management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | IV metoprolol, heparin, plan for cardioversion |
| B)     | Oral diltiazem, warfarin, follow-up in clinic |
| C)     | IV digoxin, aspirin, cardiology consultation |
| D)     | Oral metoprolol, direct oral anticoagulant, rate control strategy |
| E)     | Immediate electrical cardioversion |

## Correct Answer
D

## Explanation
This case presents new-onset atrial fibrillation requiring both rate control and stroke prevention:

1. Key Assessment Points:
   - Hemodynamically stable
   - High stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc = 4)
   - No immediate cardioversion indication
   - No underlying thyroid disease

2. Why Option D is optimal:
   - Appropriate rate control strategy
   - Modern anticoagulation approach
   - Safe for stable patient
   - Follows current guidelines

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Urgent cardioversion not needed
   - B) Warfarin less preferred than DOACs
   - C) Digoxin not first-line, aspirin insufficient
   - E) No indication for immediate cardioversion

4. Management Priorities:
   - Rate control
   - Stroke prevention
   - Identify/treat underlying causes
   - Follow-up plan
