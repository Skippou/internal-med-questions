# Complex Arrhythmia Management

## Question
A 72-year-old man with COPD, prior MI (EF 35%), and CKD presents with recurrent ICD shocks. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 100/60 mmHg
- HR: 188/min
- RR: 24/min
- SpO2: 91% on 2L NC
- Temperature: 37.2°C (99.0°F)

Recent History:
- 6 ICD shocks in last hour
- Started amiodarone 3 weeks ago
- New digoxin prescription 5 days ago

Labs:
- K⁺: 3.2 mEq/L
- Mg²⁺: 1.4 mg/dL
- Digoxin level: 2.8 ng/mL (therapeutic: 0.8-2.0)
- Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL
- TSH: 0.05 mIU/L

ECG shows VT at 188/min, different morphology from documented baseline VT.

ICD interrogation reveals:
- Multiple unsuccessful ATP attempts
- Different VT morphology from previously programmed zones
- Intermittent undersensing

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | IV lidocaine bolus + infusion, correct electrolytes |
| B)     | Emergent VT ablation with 3D mapping |
| C)     | Overdrive pacing via ICD, digoxin-binding antibodies |
| D)     | IV amiodarone load, hold other medications |
| E)     | Urgent revision of ICD system |

## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
This case presents a complex electrical storm triggered by multiple factors:

1. Contributing Factors:
   - Digoxin toxicity (high level, renal dysfunction)
   - Electrolyte abnormalities (↓K⁺, ↓Mg²⁺)
   - Hyperthyroidism
   - ICD malfunction (undersensing)
   - Possible amiodarone-digoxin interaction

2. Why Option C is optimal:
   - Overdrive pacing can terminate VT
   - Digoxin-binding antibodies address root cause
   - Avoids pro-arrhythmic medications
   - Manages both rhythm and toxicity

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Lidocaine risky with renal dysfunction
   - B) Too unstable for prolonged procedure
   - D) Amiodarone may worsen digoxin toxicity
   - E) Device revision not immediate priority

4. Critical Management Points:
   - Treat underlying toxicity
   - Correct electrolytes
   - Avoid harmful drug interactions
   - Address device issues after stabilization

5. Key Considerations:
   - Multiple interacting medications
   - Organ dysfunction affecting drug clearance
   - Device programming limitations
   - Need for immediate rhythm control
