# Complex Aortic Emergency Management

## Question
A 58-year-old man with poorly controlled hypertension presents with sudden-onset chest and back pain. Notable findings:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 185/95 mmHg (R arm), 125/70 mmHg (L arm)
- HR: 105/min
- RR: 22/min
- SpO2: 96% on RA
- Pain score: 9/10

Additional History:
- Prior aortic root dilation 4.5 cm
- Family history of Marfan syndrome
- Recent cocaine use 6 hours ago
- Initial troponin negative

Physical Exam:
- New diastolic murmur
- Asymmetric pulses
- Focal neurological deficits: Left-sided weakness
- Signs of malperfusion: Cool left arm
- No signs of HF

Initial Imaging:
- CXR: Widened mediastinum
- ECG: LVH with strain pattern
- Bedside echo: Moderate AR, dilated root
- CT scanner currently non-functional

Which immediate management step is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Transfer to nearest cardiac surgery center (45 min away) |
| B)     | Start esmolol drip, then obtain MRA |
| C)     | Emergency TEE in ED for definitive diagnosis |
| D)     | Thrombolysis for possible stroke |
| E)     | Wait for CT repair (estimated 2 hours) |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This represents likely acute aortic dissection with multiple high-risk features:

1. Classic Findings:
   - BP differential >20 mmHg
   - Asymmetric pulses
   - New AR murmur
   - Neurological deficits
   - Widened mediastinum

2. Why Option A is optimal:
   - High pretest probability
   - Multiple risk factors present
   - End-organ malperfusion
   - Time-critical condition
   - Need for surgical intervention

3. Why other options fail:
   - B) Delay without definitive care
   - C) Delays transfer, limited utility
   - D) Contraindicated if dissection
   - E) Unacceptable delay

4. Risk Factors Present:
   - Hypertension
   - Cocaine use
   - Family history
   - Known aortopathy
   - Male gender

5. Critical Care Points:
   - Control BP with beta blockade
   - Arrange emergent transfer
   - Prepare for deterioration
   - Monitor end-organs
   - Consider blood products
