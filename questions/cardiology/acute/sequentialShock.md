# Sequential Shock Management

## Initial Presentation
A 45-year-old woman is brought to the ED with acute shortness of breath and hypotension.

Initial Vital Signs:
- BP: 78/45 mmHg
- HR: 142/min
- RR: 28/min
- SpO2: 92% on 100% NRB
- Temperature: 38.8°C (101.8°F)

## Question Part 1
Which initial diagnostic test is most likely to establish the type of shock?

### Options Part 1
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Bedside cardiac ultrasound |
| B)     | Chest CT with contrast |
| C)     | Serial troponins |
| D)     | Arterial blood gas |

<details>
<summary>Answer Part 1</summary>
A) Bedside cardiac ultrasound - Rapidly differentiates between major shock types
</details>

## Additional Information 1
Bedside echo shows:
- Hyperdynamic LV
- Small/collapsing IVC
- No pericardial effusion
- Normal RV function

Labs return:
- Lactate: 5.2 mmol/L
- WBC: 22,000/µL
- Procalcitonin: 12 ng/mL
- Negative troponin

## Question Part 2
What is the most appropriate next step?

### Options Part 2
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Start norepinephrine after 30mL/kg fluid bolus |
| B)     | Begin dobutamine infusion |
| C)     | Activate cath lab for presumed cardiogenic shock |
| D)     | Urgent pericardiocentesis |

<details>
<summary>Answer Part 2</summary>
A) Start norepinephrine after 30mL/kg fluid bolus - Classic septic shock presentation
</details>

## Additional Information 2
After initial resuscitation:
- BP improves to 90/60 mmHg
- Lactate rises to 6.8 mmol/L
- Patient develops abdominal pain
- New onset atrial fibrillation

## Question Part 3
Which investigation will best guide further management?

### Options Part 3
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Abdominal CT with contrast |
| B)     | Right heart catheterization |
| C)     | TEE for endocarditis |
| D)     | Diagnostic peritoneal lavage |

<details>
<summary>Answer Part 3</summary>
A) Abdominal CT with contrast - To identify potential abdominal source given new symptoms
</details>

## Final Information
CT reveals:
- Superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism
- Bowel ischemia
- Splenic infarcts

## Final Question
What is the definitive management priority?

### Options Final
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Immediate surgical embolectomy |
| B)     | Systemic thrombolysis |
| C)     | Anticoagulation and continue antibiotics |
| D)     | Endovascular thrombectomy |

<details>
<summary>Final Answer</summary>

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This case evolved from apparent septic shock to reveal embolic complications:

1. Key Decision Points:
   - Initial shock assessment (echo)
   - Appropriate early resuscitation
   - Recognition of evolving features
   - Identification of surgical emergency

2. Why surgical embolectomy (A) is optimal:
   - Acute mesenteric ischemia requires immediate revascularization
   - Associated with bowel necrosis
   - Time-critical for survival
   - Allows direct bowel assessment

3. Why other options fail:
   - B) Too high risk, inadequate for established ischemia
   - C) Insufficient for acute arterial occlusion
   - D) Delays definitive bowel assessment

4. Learning Points:
   - Shock can have multiple/evolving components
   - New AF as source of embolism
   - Importance of serial reassessment
   - Value of systematic shock workup
   - Recognition of surgical emergencies
