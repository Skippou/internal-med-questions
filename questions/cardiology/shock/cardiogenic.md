# Cardiogenic Shock Management

## Question
A 58-year-old man with anterior STEMI develops cardiogenic shock:
- BP: 75/45 mmHg
- HR: 118/min
- Lactate: 6.5 mmol/L
- Echo: LVEF 25%, severe MR
- Swan-Ganz data:
  * RAP: 18 mmHg
  * PCWP: 28 mmHg
  * CI: 1.6 L/min/m²
  * SVR: 1800 dynes·s/cm⁵

Post-PCI status with continued deterioration. Which intervention offers best survival?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Dobutamine + nitroprusside |
| B)     | VA-ECMO + Impella |
| C)     | High-dose dopamine |
| D)     | IABP + levosimendan |
| E)     | Emergency CABG |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Correct Answer (B) Rationale:
   - VA-ECMO provides:
     * Complete cardiopulmonary support
     * Time for myocardial recovery
     * Stabilization for decision-making
   - Impella addition:
     * Left ventricular unloading
     * Reduces wall stress
     * Prevents pulmonary edema
   - Combined approach:
     * Highest survival in profound shock
     * Bridge to recovery or destination
     * Allows organ perfusion

2. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Insufficient support
     * Risk of further hypotension
     * May worsen ischemia
   
   - Option C:
     * Increased mortality shown
     * Arrhythmogenic
     * Tissue perfusion inadequate
   
   - Option D:
     * IABP shown ineffective
     * Levosimendan too slow
   
   - Option E:
     * Too high-risk acutely
     * Poor outcomes in profound shock
     * Need stabilization first
