# Complex Adult Congenital Heart Management

## Question
A 22-year-old woman with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) presents for preconception counseling. Her surgical history includes:
- Complete TOF repair at age 2
- Pulmonary valve replacement at age 15 (homograft)
- Recent progression of symptoms

Current Status:
- NYHA Class II-III symptoms
- Planning pregnancy within 6 months
- No contraception currently

Vital Signs:
- BP: 118/72 mmHg
- HR: 82/min
- RR: 18/min
- SpO2: 95% on room air

Recent Studies:
- ECG: Complete right bundle branch block, QRS 168ms
- Echo:
  * RV severely dilated, RVEF 35%
  * Moderate PR (regurgitant fraction 35%)
  * LVEF 52%
  * No residual VSD
- Cardiac MRI:
  * RV end-diastolic volume index: 168 mL/m²
  * RV end-systolic volume index: 98 mL/m²
  * Pulmonary homograft stenosis (peak velocity 3.8 m/s)
- Exercise test:
  * Peak VO2: 18 mL/kg/min (58% predicted)
  * Appropriate BP response
  * No arrhythmias

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Clear for pregnancy with close monitoring |
| B)     | Pulmonary valve replacement before conception |
| C)     | Medical optimization with beta blockers first |
| D)     | ICD placement for primary prevention |
| E)     | Advise against pregnancy permanently |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
This case highlights complex decision-making in adult congenital heart disease:

1. High-Risk Features:
   - Severe RV dilation (RVEDVI >160 mL/m²)
   - RV dysfunction (RVEF <40%)
   - Wide QRS (>160ms)
   - Significant RVOT obstruction
   - Reduced exercise capacity

2. Why PVR Before Pregnancy (B) is Optimal:
   - Prevents further RV deterioration
   - Reduces pregnancy-related complications
   - Improves exercise capacity
   - Better long-term outcomes
   - Optimal timing for intervention

3. Why Other Options Fail:
   - A) Too risky given current RV status
   - C) Medical therapy won't address mechanical issues
   - D) Not indicated without arrhythmias
   - E) Too restrictive after appropriate intervention

4. Key Management Principles:
   - Optimize hemodynamics before pregnancy
   - Address mechanical issues proactively
   - Consider long-term outcomes
   - Balance maternal/fetal risks
   - Time interventions appropriately

5. Evidence-Based Considerations:
   - WHO Class III risk for pregnancy
   - RV volumes exceed intervention threshold
   - QRS duration predicts arrhythmia risk
   - Exercise capacity below safe threshold
