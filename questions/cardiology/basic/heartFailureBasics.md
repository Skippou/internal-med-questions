# Basic Heart Failure Management

## Question
A 65-year-old man with newly diagnosed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) presents for medication initiation. 

Current Status:
- NYHA Class II symptoms
- Walking 2 blocks causes mild shortness of breath
- Can sleep flat without orthopnea

Vital Signs:
- BP: 128/78 mmHg
- HR: 76/min
- RR: 16/min
- SpO2: 97% on room air

Labs/Studies:
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
- K‚Å∫: 4.2 mEq/L
- BNP: 450 pg/mL
- Echo: LVEF 35%
- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm

Which medication should be initiated first?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
ACE inhibitors (like lisinopril) should be initiated first in stable HFrEF because:

1. Evidence-Based Benefits:
   - Reduces mortality
   - Improves symptoms
   - Slows disease progression
   - Reduces hospitalizations

2. Why ACE inhibitor First:
   - Cornerstone of HFrEF therapy
   - Well-tolerated in stable patients
   - Can be started at low dose
   - Good safety profile

3. Why other options are not first-line:
   - A) Beta blockers typically added second
   - C) Aldosterone antagonists added later
   - D) Diuretics only for volume overload

4. Key Points:
   - Start at low dose
   - Monitor blood pressure
   - Check renal function/potassium
   - Titrate gradually
