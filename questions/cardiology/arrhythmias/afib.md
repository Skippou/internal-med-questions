## Correct Answer
D

## Explanation
- CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2 indicates high stroke risk requiring anticoagulation
- DOACs are preferred over warfarin in non-valvular AF due to:
  - Lower intracranial bleeding risk
  - No need for regular INR monitoring
  - Fewer drug-drug interactions
  - More predictable anticoagulation effect
