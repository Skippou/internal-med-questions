- Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)

Additional Information:

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Key Clinical Considerations:
   - Patient is within tPA window (≤4.5 hours)
   - NIHSS indicates moderate-severe stroke
   - No contraindications except BP
   - BP must be <185/110 before tPA

2. Management Priorities:
   - Control BP safely
   - Minimize door-to-needle time
   - Monitor for complications
   - Consider concurrent thrombectomy evaluation

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Unsafe with current BP
   - C) tPA should not be skipped if eligible
   - D) Too conservative for acute presentation
   - E) Unnecessary delay in treatment
