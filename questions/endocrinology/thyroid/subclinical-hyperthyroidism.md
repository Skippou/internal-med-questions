# Subclinical Hyperthyroidism Management

## Question
A 68-year-old woman is found to have:
- TSH: 0.1 mIU/L (0.4-4.0)
- Free T4: 1.2 ng/dL (normal)
- Free T3: 3.1 pg/mL (normal)

Additional findings:
- Heart rate: 88/min
- Osteoporosis on DEXA
- No thyroid nodules on exam
- No family history of thyroid disease
- No medications affecting thyroid function

Which management approach is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Observe and recheck TFTs in 6 months |
| B)     | Start methimazole at low dose |

| D)     | Thyroid ultrasound + uptake scan |
| E)     | Total thyroidectomy |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Risk Assessment:
   - High-risk features present:
     * Age >65
     * Osteoporosis
     * Suppressed TSH
   - Increased risk of:
     * Atrial fibrillation
     * Fractures
     * Cardiovascular events

2. Treatment Rationale:
   - Low-dose methimazole:
     * Prevents progression
     * Reduces complications
     * Well-tolerated
     * Reversible option

3. Why Other Options Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Too passive given risks
     * May allow progression
   
   - Option C:
     * Too aggressive
     * Irreversible
     * Not first-line
   
   - Option D:
     * Not needed initially
     * Delays treatment
   
   - Option E:
     * Overly aggressive
     * Surgical risks unnecessary
