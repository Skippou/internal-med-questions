# Thyroid Storm Management

## Question
A 35-year-old woman with known Graves' disease presents with:
- Temperature: 39.8°C (103.6°F)
- HR: 165/min, irregular
- BP: 165/90 mmHg
- Agitation, delirium
- Burch-Wartofsky score: 75

Labs show suppressed TSH, T4 >7.0 ng/dL (90 nmol/L). Which immediate management is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Propranolol + methimazole + hydrocortisone + cooling |
| B)     | Radioactive iodine + beta-blocker |
| C)     | Total thyroidectomy within 24 hours |
| D)     | Methimazole alone + supportive care |
| E)     | Cholestyramine + plasmapheresis |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
1. Correct Answer (A) Rationale:
   - Multi-modal approach required for thyroid storm
   - Propranolol:
     * Blocks peripheral T4→T3 conversion
     * Controls cardiovascular symptoms
     * Reduces mortality
   - Methimazole:
     * Blocks new hormone synthesis
     * Preferred over PTU except in first trimester
   - Hydrocortisone:
     * Prevents relative adrenal insufficiency
     * Blocks T4→T3 conversion
   - Cooling essential for hyperthermia

2. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option B (RAI):
     * Contraindicated in thyroid storm
     * Risk of hormone release
     * Delayed effect
   
   - Option C (Surgery):
     * Too risky in unstable patient
     * Requires stabilization first
     * High perioperative mortality
   
   - Option D (Methimazole alone):
     * Insufficient for crisis
     * Doesn't address immediate symptoms
     * Mortality risk without beta-blockade
   
   - Option E (Cholestyramine/plasmapheresis):
     * Second-line therapies
     * Not first-line without standard treatment
