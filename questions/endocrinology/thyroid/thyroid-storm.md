# Thyroid Storm Management

## Question
A 32-year-old woman with known Graves' disease presents to the ED with:
- Fever: 39.8°C (103.6°F)
- HR: 165/min, irregular
- BP: 165/95 mmHg
- RR: 28/min
- Agitated, confused
- Tremulous
- Wide stare, lid lag

Labs:
- TSH: <0.01 mIU/L (0.4-4.0)
- Free T4: 7.8 ng/dL (0.8-1.8)
- Free T3: 18 pg/mL (2.3-4.2)

Which combination of immediate treatments is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | PTU + propranolol + hydrocortisone + cooling measures |
| B)     | Methimazole + metoprolol + radioactive iodine |
| C)     | Lugol's solution + aspirin + propranolol |
| D)     | PTU + diltiazem + prednisone |
| E)     | Total thyroidectomy + beta blockade |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This is a case of thyroid storm requiring prompt intervention:

1. Diagnostic Criteria (Burch-Wartofsky Score >45):
   - High fever: 39.8°C (15 points)
   - Severe tachycardia >140 (25 points)
   - Agitation/delirium (20 points)
   - GI-hepatic dysfunction absent (0 points)
   - Total score ~60 points

2. Management principles:
   - Block hormone synthesis (PTU preferred over methimazole)
     * PTU also blocks T4→T3 conversion
   - Block sympathetic effects (propranolol)
     * Non-selective β-blockade needed
   - Block hormone release (iodine solution after PTU)
   - Support adrenals (hydrocortisone)
   - Treat precipitant
   - Supportive care/cooling

3. Why other options are wrong:
   - RAI contraindicated in thyroid storm
   - Calcium channel blockers less effective
   - Surgery too risky in acute phase
   - Aspirin may increase free T4
