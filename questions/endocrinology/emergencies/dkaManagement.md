# DKA Management Decision Points

## Question
A 24-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 105/68 mmHg
- HR: 122/min
- RR: 28/min
- SpO2: 99% on room air
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)

Labs:
- Glucose: 485 mg/dL (26.9 mmol/L)
- pH: 7.12
- Bicarbonate: 8 mEq/L
- Anion gap: 28
- Potassium: 3.2 mEq/L
- Sodium: 132 mEq/L
- Beta-hydroxybutyrate: >8 mmol/L

Which initial management step is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Start insulin drip before fluid replacement |
| B)     | Begin normal saline and potassium replacement, then start insulin |
| C)     | Give bicarbonate before other interventions |
| D)     | Start insulin and fluids simultaneously |
| E)     | Give bolus of insulin then transition to subcutaneous |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Critical Management Priorities:
   - Volume replacement is first priority
   - Potassium must be ≥3.3 before insulin
   - Insulin without adequate potassium is dangerous

2. Key Points:
   - Risk of arrhythmias with low potassium
   - Volume depletion typically 4-6L
   - Insulin drives potassium intracellular

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Risks worsening hypokalemia
   - C) Bicarbonate rarely indicated
   - D) Need potassium replacement first
   - E) Continuous insulin needed initially
