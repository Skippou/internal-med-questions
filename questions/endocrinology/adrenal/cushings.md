# Cushing's Syndrome Diagnosis

## Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with:
- 18-month history of weight gain
- Easy bruising
- Proximal muscle weakness
- Depression
- New-onset hypertension
- Irregular menses

Physical exam:
- Central obesity
- Moon facies
- Purple striae
- Buffalo hump
- BP: 158/92 mmHg

Initial testing:
- 24h UFC: 280 µg/24h (normal <50)
- 1mg overnight DST cortisol: 12 µg/dL (331 nmol/L)
- ACTH: 85 pg/mL (18.7 pmol/L)
- 8am cortisol: 28 µg/dL (772 nmol/L)
- Midnight salivary cortisol: 0.35 µg/dL (9.7 nmol/L)

Which next diagnostic step is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Pituitary MRI with contrast |
| B)     | High-dose dexamethasone suppression test |
| C)     | CRH stimulation test |
| D)     | Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling |
| E)     | CT chest/abdomen/pelvis |

## Correct Answer
D

## Explanation
1. Diagnostic Assessment:
   - Confirmed hypercortisolism:
     * Elevated UFC
     * Failed overnight DST
     * Elevated midnight cortisol
   - ACTH-dependent Cushing's:
     * ACTH >20 pg/mL rules out primary adrenal
     * Suggests pituitary or ectopic source

2. Next Step Rationale:
   - IPSS indicated because:
     * Need to differentiate pituitary from ectopic
     * ACTH in intermediate range (>20 but <100)
     * High stakes decision for surgery
     * Most accurate test for source localization

3. Why Other Options Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * MRI alone insufficient
     * Many incidental adenomas
     * Can miss small tumors
   
   - Option B:
     * Less accurate than IPSS
     * Won't definitively locate source
   
   - Option C:
     * Lower accuracy than IPSS
     * Won't change management
   
   - Option E:
     * Premature without ACTH source confirmation
     * Unnecessary radiation if pituitary source
