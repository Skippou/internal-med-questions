- Normal temperature

Labs:
- WBC: 11,200/ÂµL

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
1. Assessment:
   - Moderate infection:
     * Local inflammation
     * No systemic signs
     * Probing to bone but negative X-ray
     * Intact circulation
   
2. Treatment Rationale:
   - Outpatient management appropriate:
     * No sepsis
     * No deep tissue involvement
     * Good blood supply
     * Patient stable
   
   - Oral antibiotics sufficient:
     * Broad spectrum coverage needed
     * Common pathogens covered
     * Good tissue penetration
     * Can be modified based on culture

3. Why Other Options Wrong:
   - Option B:
     * Too aggressive
     * No indication for IV therapy
     * Unnecessary hospitalization
   
   - Option C:
     * Not indicated without X-ray changes
     * Can consider if no improvement
   
   - Option D:
     * Far too aggressive
     * No tissue necrosis
     * Good blood supply
   
   - Option E:
     * Insufficient coverage
     * Won't prevent progression
