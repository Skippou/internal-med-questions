# Complex DKA Management

## Question
A 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes presents with:
- Severe abdominal pain
- Vomiting for 24 hours
- Altered mental status

Initial labs:
- Glucose: 680 mg/dL (37.8 mmol/L)
- pH: 6.95
- Bicarbonate: 5 mEq/L
- Anion gap: 32
- Na: 128 mEq/L
- K: 5.8 mEq/L
- BUN: 48 mg/dL
- Serum osmolality: 328 mOsm/kg

After 6 hours of standard DKA protocol:
- Glucose: 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L)
- Persistent acidosis (pH 7.10)
- Worsening mental status
- New focal neurologic deficits

Which immediate intervention is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Increase insulin drip rate + continue current fluids |
| B)     | Emergent head CT + mannitol + hypertonic saline |
| C)     | Switch to subcutaneous insulin + oral hydration |
| D)     | Add bicarbonate infusion + increase fluid rate |
| E)     | Decrease dextrose concentration in IV fluids |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Clinical Assessment:
   - Initial severe DKA with:
     * Profound acidosis
     * Significant hyperglycemia
     * High osmolality
   - Concerning development:
     * Rapid glucose correction
     * New neurologic deficits
     * Mental status changes
     * Suggests cerebral edema

2. Management Priority:
   - Cerebral edema is life-threatening:
     * 20-40% mortality
     * Requires immediate intervention
     * Diagnostic imaging crucial
   - Osmotic therapy:
     * Mannitol reduces ICP
     * Hypertonic saline stabilizes osmolality
     * Time-sensitive intervention

3. Why Other Options Fail:
   - Option A:
     * May worsen cerebral edema
     * Doesn't address neurologic deterioration
   
   - Option C:
     * Inappropriate during acute crisis
     * Dangerous in cerebral edema
   
   - Option D:
     * Bicarbonate controversial in DKA
     * Won't address cerebral edema
   
   - Option E:
     * Secondary concern
     * Delays critical intervention
