# Primary Hyperparathyroidism Management

## Question
A 62-year-old woman is found to have:
- Calcium: 11.2 mg/dL (2.80 mmol/L)
- PTH: 95 pg/mL (10.1 pmol/L) [elevated]
- 25-OH Vitamin D: 28 ng/mL
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
- 24h urine calcium: 320 mg/24h

Additional findings:
- Osteoporosis on DEXA (T-score -2.8)
- Renal ultrasound: 4mm non-obstructing stone
- No symptoms
- Sestamibi scan: Single inferior parathyroid adenoma

Which management approach is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Annual monitoring only |
| B)     | Medical therapy with cinacalcet |
| C)     | Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy |
| D)     | 4-gland exploration |
| E)     | Bisphosphonate therapy |

## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Surgical Indication Assessment:
   - Meets criteria for surgery:
     * Age <65
     * Osteoporosis
     * Renal stone
     * Elevated urine calcium
   - Clear localization on imaging
   - No contraindications

2. Treatment Rationale:
   - Minimally invasive approach appropriate:
     * Single adenoma identified
     * Concordant imaging
     * Lower complication risk
     * Faster recovery
     * Equal cure rate to bilateral exploration

3. Why Other Options Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Patient meets surgical criteria
     * Disease progression likely
   
   - Option B:
     * Medical therapy temporary
     * Doesn't address underlying cause
     * Reserved for non-surgical candidates
   
   - Option D:
     * Unnecessary with localized disease
     * Higher complication risk
   
   - Option E:
     * Doesn't address underlying disease
     * May mask progression
