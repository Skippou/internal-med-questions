## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
1. IGRA positivity with normal CXR and no symptoms indicates latent TB infection.  
2. Recommended therapy to prevent active disease includes isoniazid for 9 months (or alternate regimens such as 3HP).  
3. Full RIPE therapy is for active TB.  
4. Monitoring only (C) risks progression.  
5. BCG (E) is not advised post-exposure in adults.
