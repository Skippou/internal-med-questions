# Vasopressor Selection in Septic Shock

## Question
A 68-year-old man with pneumonia presents with septic shock. After receiving 30 mL/kg IV crystalloids:

Vitals/Labs:
- BP: 85/45 mmHg (MAP 58)
- HR: 115/min
- RR: 24/min
- Temp: 38.9°C (102°F)
- CVP: 12 mmHg
- ScvO2: 58%
- Lactate: 4.8 mmol/L (43.2 mg/dL)
- Cardiac Index: 4.2 L/min/m² (normal 2.5-4.0)
- SVR: 600 dynes·sec/cm⁵ (normal 800-1200)

Which combination of interventions is most appropriate at this time?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Start norepinephrine + continue fluid resuscitation |
| B)     | Start vasopressin as first-line + inotrope |
| C)     | Start epinephrine alone + hold fluids |
| D)     | Start phenylephrine + stress-dose steroids |
| E)     | Start dopamine + diuretics |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This is a classic warm septic shock case requiring specific interventions:

1. Hemodynamic Analysis:
   - Hyperdynamic state (high CI)
   - Vasodilatory shock (low SVR)
   - Tissue hypoperfusion (high lactate, low ScvO2)
   - Adequate preload (CVP 12)

2. Management Rationale:
   - Norepinephrine is first-line because:
     * Increases SVR with minimal chronotropy
     * Maintains splanchnic perfusion
     * Better survival vs dopamine
   - Continued fluids needed for:
     * Ongoing losses
     * Persistent hypoperfusion

3. Why other options are wrong:
   - Vasopressin: Second-line agent
   - Epinephrine: May worsen tachycardia/lactate
   - Phenylephrine: Poor splanchnic flow
   - Dopamine: Higher arrhythmia risk
