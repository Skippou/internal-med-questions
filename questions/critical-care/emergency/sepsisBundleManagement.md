# Early Sepsis Bundle Management

## Question
A 68-year-old man presents with fever, hypotension, and altered mental status. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 82/45 mmHg
- HR: 115/min
- RR: 24/min
- SpO2: 94% on room air
- Temperature: 38.9°C (102°F)

Labs:
- WBC: 18,500/µL with 12% bands
- Lactate: 4.2 mmol/L
- Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (baseline 0.9)
- Platelets: 98,000/µL

Additional Information:
- Suspected urinary source
- Blood cultures pending
- No drug allergies
- No significant cardiac history

Which intervention sequence is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Start norepinephrine first, then give antibiotics and 30mL/kg crystalloid |
| B)     | Give broad-spectrum antibiotics, then 30mL/kg crystalloid, then start norepinephrine if needed |
| C)     | Administer 30mL/kg crystalloid first, then antibiotics, then start vasopressors |
| D)     | Give antibiotics and start norepinephrine simultaneously, withhold fluids until central line placement |
| E)     | Start all interventions simultaneously through peripheral IV while obtaining central access |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Key Priorities in Sepsis:
   - Early appropriate antibiotics (highest mortality benefit)
   - Adequate fluid resuscitation
   - Vasopressor support when needed

2. Evidence-Based Sequence:
   - Antibiotics within 1 hour has strongest mortality benefit
   - Early fluid resuscitation improves outcomes
   - Vasopressors for fluid-refractory shock

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Delays critical antibiotic administration
   - C) Fluids before antibiotics increases time to appropriate therapy
   - D) Dangerous to withhold fluids
   - E) Uncoordinated approach may compromise care quality
