# Upper GI Bleeding Management

## Question
A 65-year-old man presents with:
- 6 hours of hematemesis
- Melena
- Taking daily aspirin
- History of peptic ulcer disease

Current findings:
- HR: 105/min
- BP: 105/65 mmHg
- Orthostatic hypotension present
- Clear lungs
- Epigastric tenderness

Labs:
- Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL (92 g/L)
- BUN: 32 mg/dL
- Platelets: 250,000/ÂµL
- INR: 1.1
- Glasgow-Blatchford score: 12

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Immediate endoscopy without medical therapy |
| B)     | IV PPI + volume resuscitation + endoscopy within 24h |
| C)     | Oral PPI + outpatient endoscopy in 48-72h |
| D)     | Transfusion to Hgb >10 g/dL + empiric antibiotics |
| E)     | Interventional radiology for embolization |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Risk Assessment:
   - High-risk features:
     * Active bleeding (hematemesis)
     * Orthostatic hypotension
     * High Glasgow-Blatchford score
     * Significant anemia
     * Risk factors (aspirin, PUD history)

2. Management Rationale:
   - IV PPI pre-endoscopy:
     * Reduces high-risk stigmata
     * Decreases rebleeding risk
     * Improves endoscopic visualization
   
   - Volume resuscitation:
     * Stabilize hemodynamics
     * Crystalloid initially
     * Target urine output/perfusion
   
   - Timing of endoscopy:
     * Within 24h optimal
     * After resuscitation
     * During normal working hours
     * Experienced team available

3. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Skips crucial stabilization
     * Higher risk of complications
     * Poorer visualization
   
   - Option C:
     * Too delayed for high-risk patient
     * Inadequate initial therapy
     * Risk of rebleeding
   
   - Option D:
     * Overtransfusion not beneficial
     * Antibiotics not routinely indicated
   
   - Option E:
     * First try endoscopic management
     * IR reserved for failed endoscopy
