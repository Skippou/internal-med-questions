# Refractory Ulcerative Colitis Management

## Question
A 29-year-old woman with extensive ulcerative colitis presents with:
- 12 bloody stools/day
- Severe abdominal pain
- Weight loss of 8 kg in 2 months
- Steroid-dependent despite optimization

Treatment history:
- Failed mesalamine
- Failed azathioprine
- Failed infliximab (primary non-response)
- Failed vedolizumab (secondary loss of response)
- Currently on high-dose prednisone

Current findings:
- Temperature: 38.5°C (101.3°F)
- HR: 112/min
- Hgb: 8.2 g/dL (82 g/L)
- Albumin: 2.8 g/dL (28 g/L)
- CRP: 85 mg/L
- Mayo score: 11

Colonoscopy shows:
- Deep ulcerations throughout colon
- No CMV inclusions
- No C. difficile
- No dysplasia

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Switch to adalimumab + continue steroids |
| B)     | Add tofacitinib with rapid steroid taper |
| C)     | Subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy |
| D)     | Ustekinumab + cyclosporine bridge |
| E)     | FMT + probiotics + budesonide |

## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Disease Severity Assessment:
   - Severe, refractory disease with:
     * High stool frequency
     * Significant blood loss
     * Severe endoscopic findings
     * High inflammatory markers
     * Failed multiple biologics
     * Steroid dependence

2. Surgical Indication Rationale:
   - Multiple treatment failures:
     * Anti-TNF primary non-response
     * Vedolizumab secondary failure
     * Steroid dependence
   - Quality of life impact
   - Risk of complications
   - Nutritional compromise
   - No proven effective medical options remain

3. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Low likelihood of response after infliximab failure
     * Same mechanism of action
     * Delays definitive treatment
   
   - Option B:
     * High risk of complications
     * Delayed onset of action
     * Safety concerns in severe disease
   
   - Option D:
     * Unproven combination
     * Risk of serious infections
     * Limited evidence in UC
   
   - Option E:
     * Insufficient for severe disease
     * Not evidence-based
     * May worsen outcomes

1. Recognition of medical failure
2. Timing of surgical referral
3. Risk-benefit assessment
4. Patient counseling
5. Postoperative considerations
