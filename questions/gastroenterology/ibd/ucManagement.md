## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Moderate UC flare unresponsive to 5-ASA often benefits from a thiopurine.  
2. IV steroids (B) reserved for severe flares.  
3. Colectomy (D) is a final intervention for refractory disease or complications.  
4. Antibiotics (E) if infection suspected; not indicated here.
