# Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis Management

## Clinical Scenario
A 45-year-old man with heavy alcohol use presents with:
- 2 weeks of jaundice
- Confusion
- Ascites
- RUQ tenderness

Current findings:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
- HR: 112/min
- BP: 108/62 mmHg
- Grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy
- Asterixis present

Labs:
- Total bilirubin: 25.2 mg/dL (431 µmol/L)
- INR: 2.1
- Albumin: 2.4 g/dL (24 g/L)
- AST: 225 U/L
- ALT: 125 U/L
- AST:ALT ratio > 2
- Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (159 µmol/L)
- WBC: 18,500/µL
- Maddrey's Discriminant Function: 62

Evaluation:
- Ultrasound shows cirrhosis with patent vessels
- Diagnostic paracentesis: SAAG 2.1, PMN 180/mm³
- MELD score: 28
- Lille score after 7 days of steroids: 0.82

Which management strategy offers the best survival benefit?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Continue prednisolone for 28 days + prophylactic antibiotics |
| B)     | Early liver transplant evaluation + supportive care + steroids discontinuation |
| C)     | Switch to pentoxifylline + G-CSF + zinc supplementation |
| D)     | Plasma exchange + intravenous N-acetylcysteine + continued steroids |
| E)     | MARS therapy + broad-spectrum antibiotics + octreotide |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
This case represents severe alcoholic hepatitis with poor prognostic indicators:

1. Severity Assessment:
   - Maddrey's DF >32 (severe)
   - MELD 28 (poor prognosis)
   - Lille score >0.45 (steroid non-responder)
   - Multiple organ dysfunction
   - High 6-month mortality risk

2. Management Rationale:
   - Early liver transplant consideration:
     * Recent paradigm shift in carefully selected patients
     * Survival benefit shown in studies
     * Limited alternative options
     * Poor response to medical therapy

   - Steroid discontinuation:
     * High Lille score indicates non-response
     * Continued steroids increase infection risk
     * No benefit shown beyond 7 days in non-responders

   - Supportive care:
     * Nutrition optimization
     * Infection prevention
     * Encephalopathy management
     * Portal pressure control

3. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Continued steroids harmful in non-responders
     * Increased infection risk
     * No survival benefit
   
   - Option C:
     * Pentoxifylline not superior to placebo
     * G-CSF benefit unproven
     * Inadequate for severity
   
   - Option D:
     * Plasma exchange experimental
     * NAC alone insufficient
     * Continued steroids harmful
   
   - Option E:
     * MARS therapy unproven
     * Cost-ineffective
     * Delays definitive therapy

## Core Concepts
1. Prognostic scoring in alcoholic hepatitis
2. Steroid response assessment
3. Transplant selection criteria
4. Timing of interventions
5. Futility assessment
