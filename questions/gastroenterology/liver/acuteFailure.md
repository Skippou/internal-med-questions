# Acute Liver Failure Management

## Question
A 25-year-old woman presents with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure:
- Grade III encephalopathy
- INR: 4.8
- Lactate: 7.2 mmol/L
- pH: 7.21
- Cr: 2.8 mg/dL (247.5 µmol/L)
- AST: 8500 U/L
- ALT: 9200 U/L
- Arterial ammonia: 155 µmol/L

King's College Criteria positive. Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | NAC + ICU monitoring + lactulose |
| B)     | Emergency liver transplant evaluation + NAC + intubation + ICP monitoring |
| C)     | MARS therapy + fresh frozen plasma |
| D)     | High-dose corticosteroids + broad spectrum antibiotics |
| E)     | Plasma exchange + vitamin K + rifaximin |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Correct Answer (B) Rationale:
   - Emergency transplant indicated:
     * Meets King's College Criteria
     * Poor prognostic indicators
     * Rapid deterioration
   - Supportive care needed:
     * NAC continues despite late presentation
     * Airway protection for encephalopathy
     * ICP monitoring guides management

2. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Insufficient for severity
     * Missing airway protection
     * Delays definitive therapy
   
   - Option C:
     * MARS unproven in acute setting
     * Delays transplant evaluation
     * Insufficient alone
   
   - Option D:
     * No role for steroids
     * May increase infection risk
     * Doesn't address underlying problem
   
   - Option E:
     * Inadequate support
     * Missing key interventions
     * Won't prevent progression

3. Additional Considerations:
   - Time-sensitive decisions crucial
   - Multi-organ support required
   - Prevention of complications vital
