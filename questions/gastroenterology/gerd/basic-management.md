## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
1. This is typical uncomplicated GERD:
   - Classic symptoms
   - No alarm features
   - Young patient
   - Recent onset

2. First-line treatment includes:
   - Lifestyle modifications:
     * Avoid trigger foods
     * Eat smaller meals
     * Avoid late meals
     * Elevate head of bed
   - Once-daily PPI:
     * Standard dose
     * Take before meals
     * Trial for 4-8 weeks

3. Why other options are wrong:
   - Option B: Endoscopy not indicated without alarm symptoms
   - Option C: H2 blockers less effective than PPIs
   - Option D: Too aggressive for initial therapy
   - Option E: Insufficient for frequent symptoms
