# Acute Liver Failure Management

## Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with jaundice and confusion 3 days after acetaminophen overdose. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 108/65 mmHg
- HR: 112/min
- RR: 22/min
- SpO2: 96% on room air
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)

Labs:
- INR: 4.2
- AST: 4500 U/L
- ALT: 5200 U/L
- Total bilirubin: 5.8 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
- Ammonia: 125 µmol/L
- pH: 7.31

Grade II hepatic encephalopathy present.

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A) N-acetylcysteine infusion |
| B) Liver transplantation evaluation |
| C) Hemodialysis |
| D) High-dose corticosteroids |

## Answer
**B) Liver transplantation evaluation**

## Explanation
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rapid deterioration of liver function, often associated with coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy. In this case, the patient has severe liver injury (markedly elevated AST and ALT), coagulopathy (INR 4.2), and hepatic encephalopathy (Grade II). The most appropriate management strategy is to evaluate the patient for liver transplantation, as this is the definitive treatment for ALF, especially when there is evidence of severe liver dysfunction and encephalopathy.

N-acetylcysteine is beneficial in acetaminophen overdose but is most effective when administered early. Hemodialysis may be considered for renal failure or severe acidosis, but it does not address the underlying liver failure. High-dose corticosteroids are not indicated in this scenario.
