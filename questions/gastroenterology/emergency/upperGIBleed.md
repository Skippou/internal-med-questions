# Acute Upper GI Bleeding Management

## Question
A 62-year-old man presents with hematemesis and melena. History of aspirin use and prior peptic ulcer. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 92/58 mmHg
- HR: 118/min
- RR: 20/min
- SpO2: 95% on room air
- Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)

Labs:
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (baseline 13.5)
- Platelets: 245,000/µL
- INR: 1.1
- BUN: 45 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL

Glasgow-Blatchford Score: 12

Which immediate management sequence is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Immediate endoscopy before other interventions |
| B)     | Volume resuscitation, PPI drip, then urgent endoscopy |
| C)     | Transfuse to Hgb >10, then evaluate for endoscopy |
| D)     | Start octreotide and antibiotics, delay endoscopy 24h |
| E)     | CT angiogram before endoscopic evaluation |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Initial Priorities:
   - Hemodynamic stabilization
   - Acid suppression
   - Risk stratification
   - Timing of endoscopy

2. Evidence-Based Approach:
   - Volume resuscitation improves outcomes
   - PPI reduces bleeding stigmata
   - Early endoscopy (within 24h) optimal
   - Restrictive transfusion strategy

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Unstable for immediate endoscopy
   - C) Overtransfusion may worsen outcomes
   - D) No evidence of variceal bleeding
   - E) Endoscopy is first-line diagnostic tool
