# Acute Pulmonary Embolism Management

## Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with acute onset dyspnea and chest pain. Recent ankle surgery 2 weeks ago. Current status:

Vital Signs:
- BP: 88/52 mmHg
- HR: 128/min
- RR: 26/min
- SpO2: 88% on 4L nasal cannula
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)

Diagnostics:
- CT-PA: Bilateral large pulmonary emboli
- TTE: RV dilation, septal bowing
- Troponin: 0.8 ng/mL (elevated)
- BNP: 880 pg/mL
- Lactate: 3.2 mmol/L

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Start unfractionated heparin drip only |
| B)     | Administer systemic thrombolysis |
| C)     | Proceed to catheter-directed therapy |
| D)     | Place IVC filter and start anticoagulation |
| E)     | Emergency surgical embolectomy |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Key Features of High-Risk PE:
   - Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg)
   - RV dysfunction
   - Elevated cardiac biomarkers
   - Evidence of shock

2. Rationale for Thrombolysis:
   - Improves hemodynamics rapidly
   - Reduces mortality in high-risk PE
   - Benefits outweigh bleeding risk
   - Early intervention crucial

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Insufficient for shock
   - C) Delays definitive therapy
   - D) Doesn't address immediate crisis
   - E) Too high-risk if thrombolysis available
