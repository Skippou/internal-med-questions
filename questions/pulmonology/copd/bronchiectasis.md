# Bronchiectasis Management

## Question
A 50-year-old patient with chronic productive cough and recurrent infections on CT shows dilated bronchi with thickened walls. Sputum grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Which therapy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                           |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| A)     | Chest physiotherapy + inhaled tobramycin |
| B)     | Oral steroids indefinitely            |
| C)     | Only supportive oxygen                |
| D)     | Immediate lobectomy                   |
| E)     | Macrolide monotherapy for 2 weeks     |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
1. Correct Answer (A) Rationale:
   - Airway clearance techniques improve mucus clearance and reduce exacerbations
   - Inhaled tobramycin for Pseudomonas:
     * Achieves high local drug concentrations
     * Minimizes systemic toxicity
     * Proven mortality benefit in colonized patients
   - Combination shown to reduce hospitalization rate by 50%

2. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option B (Oral steroids):
     * No evidence for routine use
     * Risk of immunosuppression
     * May worsen infections
   
   - Option C (Supportive oxygen):
     * Passive approach
     * Doesn't address infection
     * Disease progression continues
   
   - Option D (Immediate lobectomy):
     * Too aggressive
     * Reserved for:
       * Failed medical management
       * Localized disease
       * Massive hemoptysis
   
   - Option E (Macrolide monotherapy):
     * Inadequate for Pseudomonas
     * Risk of resistance
     * Duration too short

3. Clinical Pearls:
   - Regular airway clearance is cornerstone of therapy
   - Pseudomonas colonization marks disease severity
   - Treatment requires both infection control and mechanical clearance
   - Long-term management plan essential
