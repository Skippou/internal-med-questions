# Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Management

## Question
A 32-year-old woman with newly diagnosed microscopic polyangiitis presents with:
- Progressive dyspnea and hemoptysis
- Diffuse alveolar infiltrates on CT
- Acute kidney injury (Cr 2.8 mg/dL)
- pANCA positive
- Rapidly falling hemoglobin (12.2 → 8.4 g/dL)

Sequential BAL shows increasingly hemorrhagic returns. Despite high-dose methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, she develops:
- Worsening hypoxemia requiring intubation
- New neurologic deficits
- Hemoptysis through ETT
- Platelet count 85,000/μL

Which therapeutic strategy offers the best chance of survival?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Add rituximab + continue current therapy |
| B)     | Switch to oral cyclophosphamide + increase steroids |
| C)     | Plasma exchange + rituximab + continue steroids/cyclophosphamide |
| D)     | IVIG + methotrexate + factor VIIa |
| E)     | Anti-TNF therapy + mycophenolate |

## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Disease Severity Assessment:
   - Life-threatening DAH
   - Multi-system involvement
   - Failed initial therapy
   - Rapid progression

2. Treatment Rationale:
   - Plasma exchange:
     * Removes pathogenic antibodies
     * PEXIVAS trial showed benefit in severe vasculitis
     * Rapidly reduces inflammation
   
   - Rituximab:
     * RAVE trial showed superiority to cyclophosphamide
     * Targets B-cell mediated disease
     * Can be used with plasma exchange
   
   - Continue immunosuppression:
     * Maintains disease control
     * Prevents rebound inflammation
     * Addresses underlying pathology

3. Pathophysiologic Principles:
   - Immune complex deposition
   - Complement activation
   - Neutrophil-mediated injury
   - Endothelial damage

4. Why Other Options Fail:
   - A) Insufficient without plasma exchange
   - B) Less effective than IV therapy
   - D) Factor VIIa may worsen thrombosis
   - E) Anti-TNF contraindicated in vasculitis
