# Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia with ARDS

## Question
A 58-year-old previously healthy man presents with:
- 3 days of fever, dyspnea, productive cough
- Progressive hypoxemia requiring intubation
- Bilateral infiltrates on CXR
- Shock requiring vasopressors

Laboratory findings:
- WBC: 2,100/μL (neutropenia)
- Procalcitonin: 80 ng/mL
- Lactate: 4.5 mmol/L
- P/F ratio: 95

Blood cultures grow Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite appropriate antibiotics and lung-protective ventilation, he develops:
- Worsening shock (norepinephrine >0.5 mcg/kg/min)
- Oliguric AKI (Cr 3.2 mg/dL)
- DIC (platelets 45,000/μL, fibrinogen 80 mg/dL)
- Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (EF 25%)

Which combination of interventions would most likely improve survival?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Increase vancomycin + add caspofungin + stress-dose steroids |
| B)     | Prone positioning + VV-ECMO + hydrocortisone + ascorbic acid |
| C)     | High-dose methylprednisolone + therapeutic plasma exchange |
| D)     | Conservative fluid strategy + increase vasopressors only |
| E)     | Add inhaled nitric oxide + IVIG + activated protein C |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Clinical Features Indicating Severe Disease:
   - Post-infectious ARDS (P/F <100)
   - Septic cardiomyopathy
   - Multi-organ failure
   - Refractory shock

2. Evidence-Based Interventions:
   - Prone positioning:
     * Improves V/Q matching
     * Reduces mortality in severe ARDS
     * PROSEVA trial showed NNT of 6
   
   - VV-ECMO:
     * Indicated for refractory hypoxemia
     * EOLIA trial showed benefit in severe ARDS
     * Allows ultra-protective ventilation
   
   - Hydrocortisone:
     * Beneficial in refractory shock
     * APROCCHSS trial showed mortality benefit
     * Helps with stress response

3. Why Other Options Are Incorrect:
   - A) No indication for antifungal; known pneumococcal infection
   - C) High-dose steroids not indicated; may worsen outcome
   - D) Too conservative for multi-organ failure
   - E) Activated protein C withdrawn; no evidence for IVIG

4. Key Physiologic Principles:
   - Pneumococcal sepsis can trigger overwhelming inflammation
   - Right heart failure common in severe ARDS
   - Microvascular thrombosis contributes to organ failure
   - Endothelial dysfunction drives pathophysiology
