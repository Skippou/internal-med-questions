# Community-Acquired Pneumonia

## Question
A 55-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of productive cough with yellowish sputum, fever, and pleuritic chest pain. His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes. Physical exam reveals:
- Temperature: 39°C (102.2°F)
- RR: 28/min
- HR: 115/min
- BP: 110/70 mmHg
- SpO2: 92% on room air
- Mental status: Alert and oriented
- Lung exam: Right-sided crackles and decreased breath sounds
- Work of breathing: Using accessory muscles

Laboratory findings:
- WBC: 15,000/µL with 85% neutrophils
- Platelets: 180,000/µL
- Sodium: 133 mEq/L
- BUN: 22 mg/dL
- Arterial pH: 7.42
- PaO2: 65 mmHg on room air

Chest X-ray shows right lower lobe consolidation with small pleural effusion.

CURB-65 score: 1 point (for elevated BUN >19 mg/dL)

CURB-65 Criteria (1 point each):  
• Confusion → Patient is alert and oriented → 0 points  
• Urea >7 mmol/L (BUN >19 mg/dL) → BUN is 22 → 1 point  
• Respiratory rate ≥30/min → Patient’s RR is 28 → 0 points  
• Blood pressure (SBP <90 or DBP ≤60) → Patient’s BP is 110/70 → 0 points  
• Age ≥65 → Patient is 55 → 0 points  

Hence, the score remains 1 due to the elevated BUN.

PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index) class: III

Which initial management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                     |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| A)     | Oral azithromycin only                          |
| B)     | IV ceftriaxone plus azithromycin                |
| C)     | IV vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam        |
| D)     | Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate + azithromycin     |
| E)     | Oral levofloxacin monotherapy                   |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
This patient requires hospitalization and IV antibiotics based on several factors:

1. Severity Assessment:
   - PSI Class III with hypoxemia (SpO2 92%, PaO2 65 mmHg)
   - Tachypnea (RR 28) and tachycardia (HR 115)
   - Evidence of moderate respiratory distress

2. Treatment Choice Rationale:
   - IV ceftriaxone: Covers typical bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae)
   - Azithromycin: Adds atypical coverage (Mycoplasma, Legionella)
   - Combination therapy recommended for hospitalized patients

3. Why other options are incorrect:
   - A) Monotherapy inadequate for severity
   - C) Too broad for community-acquired pneumonia
   - D) Oral therapy inappropriate given severity
   - E) While possible, less preferred in diabetes
