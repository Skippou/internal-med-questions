# Complicated Bronchiectasis Management

## Question
A 45-year-old woman with diffuse bronchiectasis presents with:
- Increased sputum production (>100mL/day)
- FEV1 40% predicted
- 4 exacerbations in past year
- Chronic Pseudomonas colonization
- Recent hemoptysis (30mL/day)

Latest sputum culture shows multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa. Current daily symptoms significantly impact quality of life.

Which combination of therapies is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                                |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| A)     | Chronic oral azithromycin + inhaled colistin + airway clearance |
| B)     | IV ceftazidime + prednisone + nebulized saline |
| C)     | Oral ciprofloxacin + inhaled tobramycin + bronchial artery embolization |
| D)     | Lobectomy + oral antibiotics |
| E)     | Nebulized DNase + inhaled steroids only |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
1. Chronic management focuses on several goals:
   - Preventing exacerbations (macrolide therapy)
   - Controlling Pseudomonas (inhaled antibiotics)
   - Improving mucus clearance (airway clearance)

2. Evidence supports:
   - Macrolides reduce exacerbations by 50%
   - Inhaled antibiotics decrease bacterial load
   - Regular airway clearance improves symptoms

3. Other options suboptimal:
   - B) IV antibiotics reserved for exacerbations
   - C) Embolization only for severe hemoptysis
   - D) Surgery last resort
   - E) DNase not proven beneficial in non-CF bronchiectasis
