# Smoke Inhalation Injury Management

## Question
A 34-year-old man was rescued from a burning building. He complains of dyspnea and cough, with black sputum. Exam findings:
- Facial burns
- Singed nasal hair
- Hoarse voice
- Cherry-red skin coloration
- SpO₂ reading of 98% but suspected CO poisoning

Which immediate action is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| A)     | Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula       |
| B)     | High-flow 100% oxygen via non-rebreather    |
| C)     | IV antibiotics + steroids                   |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Smoke inhalation often leads to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.
2. Cherry-red skin and a falsely normal SpO₂ reading are classic findings.
3. Immediate high-flow 100% oxygen ensures maximal CO elimination.
4. Intubation is reserved for airway compromise or severe burns.
5. Antibiotics/steroids are not routinely given without specific indications.
