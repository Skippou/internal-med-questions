# Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

## Question
A 68-year-old male ex-smoker presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and dry cough for 8 months. Physical exam reveals bilateral fine inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. Pulmonary function tests show:
- FVC: 65% predicted
- DLCO: 45% predicted
- FEV1/FVC ratio: 0.85

High-resolution CT chest shows:
- Bilateral peripheral and basal predominant reticulation
- Honeycombing
- Traction bronchiectasis
- No ground-glass opacities

Which diagnostic approach is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                                |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| A)     | Surgical lung biopsy                                        |
| B)     | Empiric systemic corticosteroids                           |
| C)     | Diagnosis of IPF based on current findings                 |
| D)     | Bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsy           |
| E)     | Trial of antibiotics before further workup                 |

## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Definite UIP pattern on HRCT:
   - Peripheral/basal predominant
   - Honeycombing
   - Traction bronchiectasis
   - No inconsistent features

2. Clinical context supports IPF:
   - Age >60
   - Male sex
   - Ex-smoker
   - Progressive symptoms
   - Velcro crackles
   - Restrictive PFTs

3. No biopsy needed when:
   - Definite UIP pattern on HRCT
   - Appropriate clinical context
   - No features suggesting alternative diagnosis
