# Post-COVID-19 Pulmonary Fibrosis

## Question
A 62-year-old man presents 4 months after severe COVID-19 requiring 6 weeks of mechanical ventilation. He reports:
- Progressive exertional dyspnea
- Dry cough
- 15-pound weight loss
- Fatigue

Current findings:
- SpO2 88% walking
- Fine crackles bilaterally
- Modified MRC dyspnea scale 3/4

HRCT shows:
- Peripheral and lower lobe predominant fibrosis
- Traction bronchiectasis
- Ground glass opacities
- Architectural distortion

PFTs demonstrate:
- FVC 55% predicted
- DLCO 40% predicted
- TLC 60% predicted
- Normal FEV1/FVC ratio

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | High-dose prednisone + cyclophosphamide |
| B)     | Nintedanib + pulmonary rehabilitation + oxygen therapy |
| C)     | Pirfenidone + high-dose vitamin D + azithromycin |
| D)     | Wait and observe for 6 months then reassess |
| E)     | Immediate lung transplant evaluation |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Clinical Pattern Recognition:
   - Post-COVID ILD pattern
   - Progressive fibrotic phenotype
   - Significant functional impairment
   - Features similar to IPF

2. Treatment Strategy Rationale:
   - Nintedanib:
     * Proven effective in progressive fibrosing ILD
     * INBUILD trial data applicable
     * Targets multiple fibrotic pathways
   
   - Pulmonary rehabilitation:
     * Improves exercise capacity
     * Reduces dyspnea
     * Enhances quality of life
   
   - Oxygen therapy:
     * Indicated for exertional desaturation
     * Prevents secondary complications
     * Improves exercise tolerance

3. Pathophysiologic Considerations:
   - Post-inflammatory fibrosis
   - Aberrant wound healing
   - Epithelial injury/repair
   - Mechanical stress from ventilation

4. Why Other Options Are Suboptimal:
   - A) No evidence for immunosuppression
   - C) Pirfenidone not studied in this context
   - D) Too passive given progression
   - E) Premature without trying medical therapy
