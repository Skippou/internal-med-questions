# Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Management

## Question
A 68-year-old man presents with progressive dyspnea and dry cough for 8 months. HRCT shows peripheral and basal predominant reticular opacities with honeycombing. PFTs show:
- FVC: 65% predicted
- DLCO: 45% predicted
- FEV1/FVC: 0.85

Recent clinical deterioration includes:
- 10% FVC decline over 6 months
- Resting O2 sat: 89%
- 6MWT distance: 250m with desat to 84%

Which management strategy is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Prednisone + Azathioprine + N-acetylcysteine |
| B)     | Nintedanib or Pirfenidone + oxygen + pulmonary rehabilitation |
| C)     | Cyclophosphamide + high-dose steroids |
| D)     | Supportive care only + hospice referral |
| E)     | Urgent lung transplant evaluation |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Diagnostic criteria met for IPF:
   - Age >60
   - Typical HRCT pattern
   - No alternative cause
   - Restrictive PFT pattern

2. Disease severity indicators:
   - Moderate functional impairment
   - Significant DLCO reduction
   - Exercise desaturation
   - Progressive decline

3. Management rationale:
   - Antifibrotic therapy (nintedanib/pirfenidone) slows progression
   - Supplemental O2 indicated for resting hypoxemia
   - Pulmonary rehab improves symptoms/QoL
   - Triple therapy (option A) harmful in PANTHER trial
   - Immunosuppression ineffective
   - Too early for hospice
   - Transplant evaluation reasonable but not urgent
