# ARDS Ventilation Strategy

## Question
A 35-year-old man with severe ARDS from pneumonia shows:
- P/F ratio: 80 on PEEP 10
- Plateau pressure: 32 cmH2O
- Driving pressure: 15 cmH2O
- Tidal volume: 6 mL/kg PBW
- pH: 7.15
- PaCO2: 65 mmHg
- Hemodynamics stable

Which ventilation strategy modification is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                               |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| A)     | Increase tidal volume to 8 mL/kg to normalize pH           |
| B)     | Increase PEEP to 16 cmH2O and prone positioning           |
| C)     | Switch to airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)       |
| D)     | Start inhaled nitric oxide                                |
| E)     | Begin high-frequency oscillatory ventilation               |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Severe ARDS management priorities:
   - Optimize lung recruitment
   - Maintain lung protection
   - Accept permissive hypercapnia

2. Evidence supports:
   - Higher PEEP in severe ARDS improves oxygenation
   - Prone positioning reduces mortality
   - Combined strategy most effective

3. Why other options are incorrect:
   - A) Larger tidal volumes increase ventilator injury
   - C) APRV lacks mortality benefit evidence
   - D) NO temporary effect only
   - E) HFOV may increase mortality
