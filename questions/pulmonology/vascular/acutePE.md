# Acute Pulmonary Embolism Management

## Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with acute onset dyspnea and chest pain. Vital signs:
- BP: 85/50 mmHg
- HR: 128/min
- RR: 32/min
- O2 sat: 88% on room air

CT angiogram shows bilateral large pulmonary emboli with right ventricular strain. Troponin-I is elevated. Which immediate intervention is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                    |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| A)     | IV unfractionated heparin only                 |
| B)     | Systemic thrombolysis + heparin                |
| C)     | Catheter-directed thrombolysis                 |
| D)     | Emergency pulmonary thrombectomy               |
| E)     | DOAC + supplemental oxygen                     |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. High-risk PE (shock + RV strain) has >15% mortality.
2. Systemic thrombolysis indicated for:
   - Hypotension
   - RV dysfunction
   - Elevated cardiac biomarkers
3. Benefits outweigh bleeding risks in this scenario.
4. Other options insufficient for massive PE.
