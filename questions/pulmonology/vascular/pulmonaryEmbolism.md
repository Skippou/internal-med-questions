# Acute Pulmonary Embolism Management

## Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset dyspnea and chest pain. Recent history of right knee surgery 2 weeks ago. Vital signs:
- BP: 85/50 mmHg
- HR: 125/min
- RR: 28/min
- O2 sat: 88% on room air

CT pulmonary angiogram shows large bilateral pulmonary emboli with right ventricular strain. Troponin is elevated and BNP is 1200 pg/mL.

What is the most appropriate initial management?

## Options
| Option | Description                                             |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| A)     | IV unfractionated heparin only                           |
| B)     | Systemic thrombolysis + heparin                         |
| C)     | Catheter-directed thrombolysis                          |
| D)     | IVC filter placement                                    |
| E)     | Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) alone                 |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. This patient has high-risk PE (massive PE) with:
   - Hemodynamic instability (systolic BP <90 mmHg)
   - RV dysfunction (strain on CT)
   - Elevated cardiac biomarkers
   - Significant hypoxemia

2. Systemic thrombolysis is indicated for:
   - High-risk PE with shock/hypotension
   - No absolute contraindications
   - Recent surgery is relative contraindication but benefit outweighs risk

3. Other options inadequate:
   - A) Anticoagulation alone insufficient for shock
   - C) Too time-consuming for unstable patient
   - D) Doesn't address acute crisis
   - E) Not appropriate for unstable PE
