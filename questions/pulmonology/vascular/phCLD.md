# Pulmonary Hypertension in Chronic Lung Disease

## Question
A 62-year-old man with severe COPD (FEV1 30% predicted) develops:
- Progressive dyspnea
- Right heart failure symptoms
- 6MWT: 150m with desat to 82%

Right heart catheterization shows:
- mPAP: 38 mmHg
- PAWP: 12 mmHg
- PVR: 5 Wood units
- CI: 2.1 L/min/mÂ²

Current therapy includes optimal COPD management and oxygen. Which additional treatment is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| A)     | Add sildenafil                                            |
| B)     | Start combination ambrisentan/tadalafil                   |
| C)     | Begin IV epoprostenol                                     |
| D)     | Optimize COPD therapy only                                |

## Correct Answer
D

## Explanation
1. PH in COPD:
   - Common in severe disease
   - Usually mild-moderate
   - Primary therapy is COPD treatment

2. PAH-specific therapy:
   - Not routinely recommended
   - May worsen V/Q mismatch
   - Limited evidence in COPD
   - Can consider in severe PH with mild COPD

3. Management priorities:
   - Optimize bronchodilation
   - Ensure adequate oxygenation
   - Treat cor pulmonale
   - Consider transplant evaluation
