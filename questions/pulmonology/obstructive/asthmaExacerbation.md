# Asthma Exacerbation Management

## Question
A 25-year-old woman with a history of moderate persistent asthma presents with severe shortness of breath and wheezing for 48 hours. She has used her rescue inhaler (albuterol) frequently without improvement. Exam shows:
- RR: 32/min
- HR: 125/min
- O2 sat: 90% on room air
- Accessory muscle use
- Peak expiratory flow rate: 40% predicted

Which immediate intervention is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| A)     | Low-flow oxygen and IV fluids only          |
| B)     | Inhaled albuterol via metered-dose inhaler  |
| C)     | High-dose nebulized albuterol + ipratropium + IV steroids |
| D)     | Oral antibiotics + chest physiotherapy      |
| E)     | Subcutaneous epinephrine only               |

## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Severe exacerbation indicated by marked tachypnea, hypoxia, and low peak flow.  
2. Combination of nebulized short-acting beta-2 agonist (albuterol) and anticholinergic (ipratropium) improves bronchodilation.  
3. IV steroids reduce airway inflammation and are crucial in acute severe asthma.  
4. Antibiotics are reserved for clear evidence of bacterial infection.  
5. Subcutaneous epinephrine is more common in anaphylaxis, not typical asthma exacerbation.
