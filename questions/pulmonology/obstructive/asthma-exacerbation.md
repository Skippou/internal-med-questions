- RR: 24/min
- HR: 102/min
- BP: 138/88 mmHg
- O2 sat: 94% on room air

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Severity Assessment:
   - Moderate exacerbation:
     * Speaking difficulty but in phrases
     * Accessory muscle use
     * Peak flow 40-60% of best
     * Partial response to initial treatment
   - Not severe enough for:
     * BiPAP/intubation
     * IV magnesium
   - Too severe for discharge

2. Treatment Rationale:
   - Combination therapy:
     * Ipratropium enhances bronchodilation
     * Systemic steroids reduce inflammation
     * Continued monitoring needed
   - Evidence-based approach
   - Safe intervention

3. Why Other Options Are Wrong:
   - Option A:
     * Too early for discharge
     * Incomplete treatment
     * Needs monitoring
   
   - Option C:
     * IV magnesium for severe cases
     * BiPAP not indicated yet
   
   - Option D:
     * Too aggressive
     * No respiratory failure
   
   - Option E:
     * Aminophylline outdated
     * High side effect risk
     * Not recommended routinely
