## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. A small primary spontaneous pneumothorax may only need simple aspiration if the patient is stable.  
2. Chest tube placement (A) is for large or tension pneumothoraces or if aspiration fails.  
3. High-flow oxygen (C) and analgesics are adjuncts but not a definitive intervention.  
4. Surgical intervention (D) reserved for recurrent or persistent cases.  
5. Antibiotics (E) not routinely indicated unless infection is suspected.
