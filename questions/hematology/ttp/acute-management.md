# Complex TTP Management with Neurological Deterioration

## Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with:
- New onset seizures
- Platelets: 12,000/µL (12 x 10⁹/L)
- Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL (72 g/L)
- Schistocytes on smear
- LDH: 1200 U/L (20× ULN)
- Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL (185.6 µmol/L)
- ADAMTS13 activity pending

After starting plasma exchange, she develops:
- Status epilepticus
- Respiratory failure requiring intubation
- Cardiogenic shock (Troponin-I: 15 ng/mL)
- DIC (fibrinogen 80 mg/dL)
- Central line-associated DVT

Which management strategy offers the best survival benefit?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Double-volume plasmapheresis + rituximab + steroids + ECMO + continue anticoagulation |
| B)     | Single-volume plasmapheresis + caplacizumab + hold anticoagulation |
| C)     | Switch to hemodialysis + IVIG + platelet transfusion |
| D)     | Fresh frozen plasma infusion + cyclophosphamide + IVC filter |
| E)     | Therapeutic plasma exchange + splenectomy + antiepileptics |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This is a catastrophic TTP case with multiple life-threatening complications:

1. Disease Severity Assessment:
   - Severe thrombocytopenia with end-organ damage
   - Neurological deterioration
   - Cardiac involvement
   - Respiratory failure
   - DIC complication
   - Thrombotic complications

2. Management Rationale:
   - Double-volume plasmapheresis:
     * More rapid ADAMTS13 replacement
     * Better clearance of autoantibodies
     * Indicated in neurological deterioration
   - Rituximab:
     * Early administration improves outcomes
     * Reduces relapse risk
     * Addresses autoimmune component
   - ECMO support:
     * Manages cardiogenic shock
     * Provides respiratory support
     * Allows time for treatment response

3. Critical Considerations:
   - Anticoagulation must continue despite bleeding risk:
     * Catastrophic microthrombi formation
     * Central line maintenance
     * DVT presence
   - Platelet transfusion contraindicated unless life-threatening bleeding
   - IVC filter contraindicated (increases thrombosis risk)
   - Splenectomy outdated, high mortality risk

4. Expected Outcomes:
   - Mortality >90% without aggressive intervention
   - ~70% survival with optimal management
   - Neurological recovery possible with prompt treatment
