## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Unprovoked DVT generally requires at least 3 months of anticoagulation.  
2. Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban/apixaban) are often first-line.  
3. Extended therapy may be necessary if the patientâ€™s bleeding risk is low.  
4. Compression stockings help with symptom control but are not definitive.  
5. IVC filters are for contraindications or recurrent VTE on adequate therapy.
