# Iron Deficiency Anemia Treatment

## Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with:
- Fatigue
- Occasional dizziness
- Heavy menstrual periods

Labs show:
- Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL (98 g/L)
- MCV: 76 fL
- Ferritin: 8 ng/mL (8 Âµg/L)
- Iron saturation: 12%
- Normal B12 and folate

She is hemodynamically stable with no active bleeding. Which initial treatment is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Oral ferrous sulfate + vitamin C |
| B)     | Immediate IV iron infusion |
| C)     | Red blood cell transfusion |
| D)     | Iron + B12 + folate combination |
| E)     | Monitor and recheck in 3 months |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
1. Classic iron deficiency anemia:
   - Low ferritin (definitive)
   - Low iron saturation
   - Microcytic anemia (low MCV)
   - Clear etiology (menorrhagia)

2. Treatment principles:
   - Oral iron is first-line for:
     * Stable patients
     * Mild-moderate anemia
     * No malabsorption
   - Vitamin C improves absorption
   - Take on empty stomach
   - Expected response: 1-2 g/dL rise per month

3. Why other options are wrong:
   - Option B: IV iron reserved for:
     * Severe anemia
     * Malabsorption
     * Failure of oral therapy
   - Option C: Transfusion not indicated:
     * Stable patient
     * No severe symptoms
     * Hgb > 7 g/dL
   - Option D: No B12/folate deficiency
   - Option E: Too passive for symptomatic anemia

## Teaching Points
1. Recognize iron deficiency pattern
2. Choose appropriate iron replacement
3. Understand monitoring approach
4. Know indications for parenteral iron
5. Identify when transfusion needed
