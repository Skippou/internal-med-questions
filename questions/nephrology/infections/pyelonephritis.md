# Acute Pyelonephritis Management

## Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with:
- Fever 38.8°C (101.8°F)
- Right flank pain
- Dysuria
- Nausea
- No prior UTIs

Labs show:
- WBC: 15,000/µL with 85% neutrophils
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (97.2 µmol/L)
- Urinalysis: 
  * Many WBCs
  * Positive nitrites
  * Positive leukocyte esterase
  * WBC casts

Local E. coli resistance to fluoroquinolones is 22%. She has no allergies.

Which empiric treatment is most appropriate?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Oral ciprofloxacin |
| B)     | IV ceftriaxone followed by oral cephalexin |
| C)     | Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole |
| D)     | IV ampicillin-sulbactam |
| E)     | Oral nitrofurantoin |

## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Initial assessment shows:
   - Systemic symptoms (fever)
   - Upper tract involvement (flank pain)
   - Significant inflammation (WBC casts)
   - No risk factors for resistance
   - No prior treatment failures

2. Treatment principles:
   - Initial IV therapy indicated due to:
     * Systemic symptoms
     * Need for reliable drug delivery
     * High tissue penetration
   - Step-down to oral appropriate after clinical improvement
   - Coverage for typical uropathogens needed

3. Why other options are wrong:
   - Option A: High local resistance rate (>20%)
   - Option C: High resistance rates, unreliable tissue levels
   - Option D: Unnecessarily broad spectrum
   - Option E: Poor tissue penetration, not for pyelonephritis

## Teaching Points
1. Recognition of upper vs lower UTI
2. Impact of local resistance patterns
3. Role of IV to PO step-down
4. Appropriate antibiotic selection
5. Duration of therapy considerations
