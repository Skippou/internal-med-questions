# Metabolic Alkalosis Evaluation

## Question
A 54-year-old woman with history of CHF presents with 2 weeks of nausea and weakness. She's been taking high doses of furosemide. Labs show:

- pH: 7.52
- pCO2: 48 mmHg (6.4 kPa)
- HCO3: 38 mEq/L (38 mmol/L)
- Na: 132 mEq/L (132 mmol/L)
- Cl: 86 mEq/L (86 mmol/L)
- K: 2.8 mEq/L (2.8 mmol/L)
- Urine Cl: 12 mEq/L (12 mmol/L)
- BP: 110/70 mmHg
- Volume status: clinically hypovolemic

Which statement best explains her acid-base disorder and appropriate management?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Contraction alkalosis; treat with isotonic saline and potassium replacement |
| B)     | Diuretic-induced alkalosis; treat with KCl and continue diuretics |
| C)     | Primary metabolic alkalosis; treat with acetazolamide |
| D)     | Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation; no treatment needed |
| E)     | Mixed alkalosis; treat with fluid restriction and hydrogen chloride |

## Correct Answer
A

## Explanation
This case represents chloride-responsive (saline-responsive) metabolic alkalosis:

1. Key diagnostic findings:
   - Elevated pH and HCO3 confirm metabolic alkalosis
   - Low urine Cl (<20 mEq/L) suggests chloride-responsive state
   - Hypokalemia and hypovolemia from diuretic use
   - Appropriate respiratory compensation (expected pCO2 = 0.7 × HCO3 + 20 ± 5)

2. Pathophysiology:
   - Volume contraction from furosemide leads to:
     * Increased bicarbonate reabsorption
     * Enhanced K+ and H+ exchange
     * Chloride depletion maintaining alkalosis

3. Management principles:
   - Volume repletion with NaCl restores chloride
   - K+ replacement essential for recovery
   - Underlying CHF needs careful monitoring
   - Diuretic adjustment may be needed
