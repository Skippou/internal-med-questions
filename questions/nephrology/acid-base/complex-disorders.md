# Complex Acid-Base Disorder Analysis

## Question
A 62-year-old diabetic presents with severe diarrhea, DKA, and acute kidney injury. Labs show:

- pH: 7.21
- pCO2: 24 mmHg (3.2 kPa)
- HCO3: 9 mEq/L (9 mmol/L)
- Na: 141 mEq/L (141 mmol/L)
- Cl: 112 mEq/L (112 mmol/L)
- K: 5.8 mEq/L (5.8 mmol/L)
- Glucose: 485 mg/dL (26.9 mmol/L)
- BUN: 68 mg/dL (24.3 mmol/L urea)
- Cr: 2.8 mg/dL (247.5 µmol/L)
- Anion gap: 20 (same in both systems)
- Delta gap: 2.0 (same in both systems)
- Delta ratio: 0.8 (same in both systems)

Which combination of acid-base disorders best explains these findings?

## Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A)     | Metabolic acidosis (high AG) + Respiratory acidosis |
| B)     | Metabolic acidosis (high AG) + Metabolic acidosis (normal AG) |
| C)     | Metabolic acidosis (high AG) + Respiratory alkalosis |
| D)     | Triple disorder: Metabolic acidosis (high AG) + Metabolic acidosis (normal AG) + Respiratory alkalosis |
| E)     | Metabolic acidosis (high AG) + Metabolic alkalosis |

## Correct Answer
D

## Explanation
This is a complex triple disorder:

1. Primary disorders identification:
   - High anion gap metabolic acidosis (DKA)
     * Elevated AG = 20
     * Ketoacidosis from DKA
   - Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis
     * GI bicarbonate loss from diarrhea
     * Delta ratio 0.8 suggests mixed metabolic acidosis
   - Respiratory alkalosis
     * Expected pCO2 = (1.5 × HCO3) + 8 ± 2
     * Expected = 21.5 mmHg
     * Actual = 24 mmHg
     * Relative respiratory alkalosis present

2. Supporting evidence:
   - Delta gap = 2.0 confirms additional non-AG acidosis
   - Multiple appropriate clinical triggers:
     * DKA causing high AG acidosis
     * Diarrhea causing normal AG acidosis
     * Respiratory compensation plus sepsis/DKA driving respiratory alkalosis

3. Clinical pearls:
   - Multiple disorders often coexist in critically ill patients
   - Delta ratio helps identify mixed metabolic disorders
   - Clinical context crucial for interpretation
