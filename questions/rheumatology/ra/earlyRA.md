## Correct Answer
C

## Explanation
1. Methotrexate is first-line DMARD for RA.  
2. Folinic acid (leucovorin) or folate supplementation helps reduce side effects.  
3. NSAIDs and low-dose steroids (B) can be adjunctive, not monotherapy.  
4. Biologics (D) typically added if inadequate response to methotrexate.  
5. Analgesics alone (E) won't control disease progression.
