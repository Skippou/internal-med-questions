## Correct Answer
B

## Explanation
1. Critical First Steps:
   - IM epinephrine is first-line
   - Lateral thigh injection optimal
   - Supine position improves hemodynamics
   - Early airway assessment crucial

2. Key Management Points:
   - Delay increases mortality
   - IV fluids support BP
   - Antihistamines/steroids secondary
   - Monitor for biphasic reaction

3. Why other options fail:
   - A) Antihistamines too slow
   - C) Delays essential epinephrine
   - D) Premature intubation risk
   - E) IV epi too dangerous initially
