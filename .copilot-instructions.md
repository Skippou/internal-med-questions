# Question Creation Guidelines

## File Organization
Questions must be saved following this path structure:
```
questions/[specialty]/[category]/[specific-topic].md

Categories include:
- acute/     (emergency conditions)
- chronic/   (long-term conditions)
- shortform/ (quick questions)
- basics/    (fundamental concepts)
- emergency/ (critical situations)
```

## Metadata Format
```yaml

specialty: cardiology|endocrinology|etc
topic: specific_topic
difficulty: easy|medium|hard

## Unit Formatting
Always provide both metric and imperial units using the following format:
```markdown
- Vital Signs:
  * Temperature: 38.5°C (101.3°F)
  * Weight: 82 kg (180.8 lbs)
  * Height: 175 cm (5'9")

- Lab Values:
  * Glucose: 5.5 mmol/L (99 mg/dL)
  * Creatinine: 88 µmol/L (1.0 mg/dL)
  * Hemoglobin: 140 g/L (14.0 g/dL)

- Measurements:
  * Volume: 2 L (67.6 fl oz)
  * Pressure: 120/80 mmHg (same in both systems)
  * Length: 4 cm (1.6 in)
```

Common Conversions:
- Temperature: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
- Weight: kg × 2.205 = lbs
- Height: cm × 0.394 = inches
- Glucose: mmol/L × 18 = mg/dL
- Creatinine: µmol/L × 0.0113 = mg/dL

## Complexity Levels
Ultra-hard questions should include:
- Multiple organ systems
- Complex pathophysiology
- Risk-benefit analysis
- Multiple decision points
- Integration of multiple guidelines
- Time-sensitive management
- Resource consideration
- Team coordination aspects

## Answer Distribution Guidelines
To avoid bias, maintain the following distribution across question sets:
- Option A: 20-25%
- Option B: 20-25%
- Option C: 20-25%
- Option D: 15-20%
- Option E: 15-20%

Tips for maintaining distribution:
1. Alternate correct answers when multiple approaches are valid
2. Consider different treatment strategies that are evidence-based
3. Ensure wrong answers are plausible but clearly incorrect
4. Review answer distribution every 10 questions
5. Adjust if any option exceeds 25% frequency

Example balance for 20 questions:
- A: 4-5 questions
- B: 4-5 questions
- C: 4-5 questions
- D: 3-4 questions
- E: 3-4 questions

### Correct Answer:
- State why it's correct
- Link to relevant guidelines/evidence
- Explain key clinical reasoning

### Incorrect Answers:
For each wrong option, explain:
- Why it's incorrect
- Common misconception it represents
- Potential harm if selected
- Clinical scenarios where it might be considered

## Tags
Use standardized tags from tags.md for consistency

### LLM Tags
Ensure the the LLM model int the list of tags are used to generate the question is included in the tags list.

## Shortform Questions Format
```yaml

id: SPECIALTY-SF### (e.g., CARD-SF001)
specialty: cardiology|endocrinology|etc
topic: specific_topic
difficulty: easy|medium|hard
type: shortform
tags: [tag1, tag2]

```

### Shortform Structure
```markdown

## Question 2
Which finding suggests VT over SVT with aberrancy:

- A) Fusion beats
- B) RS complex >100ms
- C) AV dissociation
- D) All of the above

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
D) All of the above - Fusion beats, wide RS complex >100ms, and AV dissociation are classic VT findings
</details>
```

### Shortform Guidelines
1. Format:
   - 5 questions per file
   - Single-line question format
